<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate"><h3>Quantum logic gate</h3></a><p>In quantum computing and specifically the quantum circuit model of computation, a <b>quantum logic gate</b> is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits. They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic gates are for conventional digital circuits.</p>
