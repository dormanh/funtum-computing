<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform"><h3>Quantum Fourier transform</h3></a><p>In quantum computing, the <b>quantum Fourier transform (QFT)</b> is a linear transformation on quantum bits, and is the quantum analogue of the discrete Fourier transform. The quantum Fourier transform is a part of many quantum algorithms, notably Shor's algorithm for factoring and computing the discrete logarithm, the quantum phase estimation algorithm for estimating the eigenvalues of a unitary operator, and algorithms for the hidden subgroup problem. The quantum Fourier transform was discovered by Don Coppersmith.</p>
