<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm"><h3>Euclidean algorithm</h3></a><p>In mathematics, the <b>Euclidean algorithm</b>, or <b>Euclid's algorithm</b>, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers (numbers), the largest number that divides them both without a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, who first described it in <span>his <i>Elements</i></span> .
It is an example of an <i>algorithm</i>, a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules,
and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form, and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.</p>
