<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference"><h3>Wave interference</h3></a><p>In physics, <b>interference</b> is a phenomenon in which two waves combine by adding their displacement together at every single point in space and time, to form a resultant wave of greater, lower, or the same amplitude. <b>Constructive</b> and <b>destructive interference</b> result from the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency. Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves, for example, light, radio, acoustic, surface water waves, gravity waves, or matter waves.</p>
