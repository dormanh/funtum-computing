<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement"><h3>Quantum entanglement</h3></a><p><b>Quantum entanglement</b> is the physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics.</p>
