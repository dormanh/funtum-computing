<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics)"><h3>Operator (physics)</h3></a><p>In physics, an <b>operator</b> is a function over a space of physical states onto another space of physical states. The simplest example of the utility of operators is the study of symmetry. Because of this, they are very useful tools in classical mechanics. Operators are even more important in quantum mechanics, where they form an intrinsic part of the formulation of the theory.</p>
