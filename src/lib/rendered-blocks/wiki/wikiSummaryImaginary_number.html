The square of an imaginary number <span class="texhtml mvar" style="font-style:italic">bi</span> is <span class="texhtml ">−<i>b</i><sup>2</sup></span>. For example, <span class="texhtml ">5<i>i</i></span> is an imaginary number, and its square is <span class="texhtml ">−25</span>. By definition, zero is considered to be both real and imaginary.</p>
