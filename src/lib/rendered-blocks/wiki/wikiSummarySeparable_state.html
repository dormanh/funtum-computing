<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_state"><h3>Separable state</h3></a><p>In quantum mechanics, <b>separable states</b> are quantum states belonging to a composite space that can be factored into individual states belonging to separate subspaces. A state is said to be entangled if it is not separable. In general, determining if a state is separable is not straightforward and the problem is classed as NP-hard.</p>
