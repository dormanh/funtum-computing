<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function"><h3>Linear function</h3></a><p>In mathematics, the term <b>linear function</b> refers to two distinct but related notions:</p><ul><li>In calculus and related areas, a linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line, that is, a polynomial function of degree zero or one. For distinguishing such a linear function from the other concept, the term affine function is often used.</li>
<li>In linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and functional analysis, a linear function is a linear map.</li></ul>
