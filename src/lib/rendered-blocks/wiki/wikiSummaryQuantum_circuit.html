<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit"><h3>Quantum circuit</h3></a><p>In quantum information theory, a <b>quantum circuit</b> is a model for quantum computation, similar to classical circuits, in which a computation is a sequence of quantum gates, measurements, initializations of qubits to known values, and possibly other actions. The minimum set of actions that a circuit needs to be able to perform on the qubits to enable quantum computation is known as DiVincenzo's criteria.</p>
