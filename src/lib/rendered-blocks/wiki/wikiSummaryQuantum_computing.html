<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing"><h3>Quantum computing</h3></a><p><b>Quantum computing</b> is a type of computation whose operations can harness the phenomena of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement. Devices that perform quantum computations are known as <b>quantum computers</b>. Though current quantum computers are too small to outperform usual (classical) computers for practical applications, larger realizations are believed to be capable of solving certain computational problems, such as integer factorization, substantially faster than classical computers. The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum information science.</p>
