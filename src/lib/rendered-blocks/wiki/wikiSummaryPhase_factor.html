<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_factor"><h3>Phase factor</h3></a><p>For any complex number written in polar form, the <b>phase factor</b> is the complex exponential factor. As such, the term "phase factor" is related to the more general term phasor, which may have any magnitude. The phase factor is a unit complex number, i.e. a complex number of absolute value 1. It is commonly used in quantum mechanics.</p>
