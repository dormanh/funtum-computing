<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state"><h3>Quantum state</h3></a><p>In quantum physics, a <b>quantum state</b> is a mathematical entity that provides a probability distribution for the outcomes of each possible measurement on a system. Knowledge of the quantum state together with the rules for the system's evolution in time exhausts all that can be predicted about the system's behavior. A mixture of quantum states is again a quantum state. Quantum states that cannot be written as a mixture of other states are called <b>pure quantum states</b>, while all other states are called <b>mixed quantum states</b>. A pure quantum state can be represented by a ray in a Hilbert space over the complex numbers, while mixed states are represented by density matrices, which are positive semidefinite operators that act on Hilbert spaces.</p>
